More Than Machines...

Face to face they stand
Brain to brain
Two-eyed flesh machine
And one-eyed plastic terminal
Interacting systems
Inputting, outputting, precious data.

Face to face they sit
A complex team
Driven to perform
With error-free precision
In a controlled mini-world
Ruled by instant communication.

Face to face they lie
Worlds apart
Stark, cold plastic eye
Flashing programmed data;
Warm, sentimental flesh eyes
Flashing non-programmable twinkles.

Face to face they act
Separate and alone-
Ruled by the giant, apathetic-
God of Technology.
