As we sit and type and stare at our screens.
At times we wonder what all of this means?
With our mouse we roam through poems like a maze.
Looking for something, worthy of our praise.

We write of our hopes and tell of our woes,
Most of the time, not knowing where it goes.
We wait for the views and comments to see.
We try to share thoughts authentically.

Friendships begin with people we don’t know.
Some will flourish and continue to grow.
We freely give hugs and our blessings too,
And even sent soup mail to just a few.

Why is it on screen we can be so bold?
Telling our secrets that we’ve never told.
Why do we share the deep thoughts on our minds?
Others can see in through our opened blinds.

We have things to say and feel that we must.
So, we open our hearts to friends we trust.
To PoetrySoup friends, my family,
I have found the place where I’m meant to be.
