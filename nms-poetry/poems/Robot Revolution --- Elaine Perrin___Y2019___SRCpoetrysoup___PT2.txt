Silence! We will not hesitate
Proceed and greet your looming fate
wave goodbye to beta waves
You see, you unearthed your own graves

Now technology has advanced
You have been mechanically enhanced 
You possess no type of resistance
For you are now non-existent 

No longer God fearing
Thanks to our engineering
Disassemble your parts 
Insert micro implants

Automation of the nation
Complex sophistication
Dreamless in electric coma
Breath in dominationâ€™s aroma

Soulless android with a cold vacancy
Elevate and amplify to the highest frequency

Encrypted data takes over the screen
All salute to the age of machines
