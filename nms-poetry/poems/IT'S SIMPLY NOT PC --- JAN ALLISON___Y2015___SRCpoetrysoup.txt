My finger hovers
Shall I turn you on today
You lie there tempting me
I need to know what buttons to press
But when I press those buttons
You respond immediately and burst into life
Every Wednesday you leave me little messages
I try to ignore them but you are so persistent
You want to update
I want to write
I press any key to continue
And you ignore me and update anyway
My husband is fed up with the distress you cause me
He has a cunning plan to fix you forever ...
No more automatic updates
From now on you and I can live together in perfect harmony
I can press the right keys to update you when it suits ME
Now I am in complete control!
