I reminisce, I miss....

The smell of fresh home baked cookies,

today they come from a box of stale goodies.

Please and thank you,

now very seldom heard.

When kids were kids just having fun,

not tied to a computer so they cannot run.

Life was work hard with simple things,

like flowers you would bring.

The days of old are long gone,

never to return.

The ones I loved,

the ones that loved me are all gone.

I reminisce, I miss....
