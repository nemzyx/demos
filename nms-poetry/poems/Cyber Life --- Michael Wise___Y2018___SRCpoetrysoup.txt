The little mouse is scrolling
as the ocean waves are rolling
and they beckon me to come down to the sea

The screen before me glowing
while outside the flowers growing
have a fragrance that is calling out to me

The keyboard keeps me busy
at the same time I am dizzy
yet the birdsongs out my window sound so sweet

While the gigabytes are loading
my poor eyeballs are exploding
and the circulation doesn’t reach my feet

One last video, I say
then another makes its way
interrupting my intentions to go out

One more minute, then I’ll quit
one more hour, here I sit
I’ve forgotten just what life is all about

There is work and there is play
but somewhere along the way
all my play times are so few and far between

Push a button, L O L
while my spirit goes to hell
as I live my cyber life upon a screen
