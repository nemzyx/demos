"User name" and "password"
That's all you need to know.
Type them in , press "enter"
Then you’re  fine to go.

Sounds quite simple really,
Till your memory starts to wane,
You trawl the deepest caverns
Of your tired and aging brain.

You thump the keyboard harder
As your temper starts to fray,
And curse the screen before you
With its "road block" in the way.

No pet, place or loved one’s name
Will give you access rights,
When you cannot remember
Those all important bytes.

Defeated, crazed you finally press
 "Forgot your password?" key
But can't answer all the questions
To get you through security 

To release your rescue e-mail
From this digital dictator,
Requires you reacquaint yourself 
With your "administrator" ?
